<h2>What is the IUCN Red List?</h2>
<div class="IUCN">
    <div class="iucnexplain">The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species has evolved to become the world's most comprehensive information source on the global conservation status of animal, fungi and plant species</div>

    <h2>Polar Bears</h2>
    <img src="../images/polar-bears-wildlife-snow-nature-preview.jpg" class="animalimg" alt="polar bear">
    <p>
        Polar bears are classified as vulnerable on the IUCN red list. In an environment that is changing, polar bears face several difficulties. Since polar bears depend on sea ice to hunt seals, mate, and migrate, sea ice loss brought on by global warming is their biggest threat. Other dangers include disturbances to dens, commerce, conflicts with humans and polar bears, and pollution.

    <h2>Gorillas</h2>
    <img src="../images/gorilla.jpg" class="animalimg" alt="gorilla">
    <p>
        Gorillas are incredible creatures that have 98.3% of our DNA in common. They are able to experience emotions just like we do, and they occasionally act just like us. There are two subspecies of the gorilla, the eastern and western. On the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, three of the four are classified as Critically Endangered. The Mountain Gorilla, a subspecies of the Eastern Gorilla, which is regarded as Endangered, is the only one that isn’t.

    <h2>Tigers</h2>
    <img src="../images/tigers.jpeg" class="animalimg" alt="tiger">
    <p>
        Tigers are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. An estimated 95% of the historical range of tigers has been gone. Human activities have damaged, fractured, and destroyed their environment. Tiger habitats are seriously threatened by the removal of forests for agriculture and logging, as well as by the construction of road networks and other development projects. The biggest threat to wild tigers right now is poaching. In illegal wildlife marketplaces, tigers' entire bodies, from whiskers to tails, have been discovered.

    <h2>Fin Whale</h2>
    <img src="../images/finwhale.jpeg" class="animalimg" alt="fin whale">
    <p>
        Fin Whales are considered Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Fin whales in the North Atlantic are classified as endangered because they were used as food, baleen, and fuel by commercial whalers up to the 20th century. As a result, certain populations are doing better. Fin whales, like other large whales, are in danger from environmental changes such habitat loss, toxins, and climate change.

<div class="animal">
    <h2>Sea Otters</h2>
    <img src="../images/seaotters.jpeg" class="animalimg" alt="sea otter">
    <p>
        Sea otters are classified as endangered on the red list. Although the sea otter population has increased since these animals became protected, its geographic range has not expanded to match. The main danger to sea otter populations is humans. Sea otters are negatively impacted by direct human interaction, such as shootings, boat collisions, and entanglements in fishing gear, but the biggest dangers come from oil spills, pollution, disease, and kelp loss.
